## APIServer APIs

This package aims to expose types from the plugins-sdk in the grafana apiserver.

Currently, the types are not useable directly so we can avoid adding a dependency on k8s.io/apimachinery
until it is more necessary.  See https://github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-sdk-go/pull/909

The "v0alpha1" version should be considered experimental and is subject to change at any time without notice.
Once it is more stable, it will be released as a versioned API (v1)


### Codegen

The file [apis/data/v0alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go](data/v0alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go) was generated by copying the folder structure into
https://github.com/grafana/grafana/tree/main/pkg/apis and then run `hack/update-codegen.sh data` in [hack scripts](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/tree/v10.3.3/hack).
